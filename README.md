# RGB-Histogram-Equalization
This project demonstrates a complete workflow for image enhancement using histogram equalization on RGB images. The program downloads an image directly from a provided URL, processes it using OpenCV and NumPy, and visualizes both the original and enhanced images along with their individual color channels and histograms.
-----------
## This project demonstrates how to:
- Load an image directly from a URL using Python, OpenCV, and Requests.
- Display RGB channels and their histograms.
- Apply histogram equalization on each RGB channel to enhance image contrast.
-------
## Tools
- Python
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Requests
----------
## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `opencv-python`, `matplotlib`, `requests`, and `numpy`.
2. Run the script to download an image from the internet, process it, and display results.
3. Modify the URL in the script to use your own images if desired.
