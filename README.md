# RGB-Histogram-Equalization
This project demonstrates a complete workflow for image enhancement using histogram equalization on RGB images. The program downloads an image directly from a provided URL, processes it using OpenCV and NumPy, and visualizes both the original and enhanced images along with their individual color channels and histograms.
